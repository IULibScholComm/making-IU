The university traditionally upholds the ideal of human values in society. One would expect that the university, having had the benefit of the services of men and women at their peak, would retain them in their waning years. It is the totality of their service that should determine the reckoning.

Universities, as human institutions, are composed of individuals who occupy a variety of specific roles. Historically, they are composed of three primary groups: students, teachers, and administrators. Each group has characteristic duties, norms, and procedures that interact to structure the institution in relation to its manifest goals of knowledge creation, transfer, and preservation. The heart of the learning process is the relation between teacher and student, with administrators playing supporting roles to organize and facilitate learning.  

Universities keep track of the members of their academic community with bureaucratic procedures of admission and hiring, documentation of advancement toward goals, and the commemoration of accomplishment. All these activities produce written records, whether inscribed on paper, photographically, or digitally. 

For the past two centuries, Indiana University has retained a record of each matriculated student and their progress toward a diploma.^[The IU Office of the Registrar is responsible. During the university's bicentennial, staff members began making some records public. See ["The First 200 Degrees"](https://first200.iu.edu/index.html) for biographical records of IU's first two hundred graduates.] The completion of degree requirements culminates in the graduation ritual known as commencement. Former students, whether they graduate or not, become members of the alumni body, which also maintains records. In a similar fashion, a faculty records office keeps track of the employment history of members of the academic staff. In contrast to the limited time that students are working toward their degrees, the faculty and administrative staff typically spend longer periods at the university---often much longer. When faculty retire, they are usually given the honorary designation "professor emerita" or "professor emeritus" and feted at a ritual reception hosted by the administration and attended by their colleagues.  

Keeping such vital information has been a tortuous process, with natural disasters and technological progress punctuating the history of archival preservation as individual records accumulate. Two major fires---in 1854 and 1883---destroyed books and papers at the small campus. Library collections were painstakingly rebuilt each time, but university records and faculty papers were obliterated, leaving large gaps in institutional archives for the nineteenth century. 

Biography is essential to the writing of university history and understanding the limitations of as well as opportunities provided by different forms of archival preservation can be illuminating. Luckily, the nineteenth-century institutional record was partially restored by Theophilus Wylie's monumental work, discussed below.^[@wylie1890a. See also @sec-three.]

Like many aspects of IU's history, commemorative policy and practice can be traced back to IU's "second beginning" in 1885, when the university abandoned its original site on Seminary Square and moved across town to establish the campus at Dunn's Woods. The proximate cause was an 1883 fire that destroyed Science Hall, one of the two main buildings. The original campus was occupied for sixty years, from 1825 to 1885, and the buildings had generic or functional names, such as the Seminary Building, College Building, and Science Hall. The new campus was a twenty-acre woodlot, purchased from the Dunn family, located on the eastern edge of town. The trustees optimistically christened it University Park.[@botm1884c] But the new name did not catch on, and reference to the relocated campus at "Dunn's Woods" endured, a harbinger of a shift in IU's naming practices to personal names. 

Bloomington, now numbering almost 3,500 residents, was coming into its own as a city. It was featured prominently in an 1884 commercial publication of county history, and IU was mentioned many times: 

>A detailed history of this university cannot be given in this volume; neither can suitable or merited personal sketches be written of the many eminent men [*sic*] who have been connected with it, or have gone as students from its halls to honored positions in almost every State in the Union. It is appropriate, however, to say that the institution has been the soul of Bloomington. A majority of the older citizens are graduates or under-graduates, and their children and grandchildren are now treading in their footsteps.[@blanchard1884a, p. 479.]

The city was being modernized, with new transportation options and more municipal utilities available. 

As city leaders of Bloomington heard about the planned relocation of the IU campus to Dunn's Woods, they decided to honor one of the most distinguished members of the faculty. In March 1884, Fifth Street was renamed for Professor Daniel Kirkwood, a theoretical astronomer who calculated regular intervals in the asteroid belt---the eponymous "Kirkwood's gaps"---leading to the sobriquet "the Kepler of America." The *Bloomington Telephone* reported: 

>Since the location of the new University buildings have been known, the citizens, and especially those on 5th street, have been talking of naming that thoroughfare Kirkwood Avenue, in honor of our distinguished townsman, Prof. Kirkwood. Last Friday night a petition was properly presented to the Council, and by a vote the name was so changed. The new University buildings now front on Kirkwood Avenue, if you please.^[@bt1884a. See also @edmondson2000a, p. 32, who mistakenly dated it as 1885.] 

Kirkwood, at the university since 1856, enjoyed an international reputation for his scientific contributions. A popular teacher, he was tolerant and indulgent in the classroom. 

A couple of months later, the IU Board of Trustees decided to name the new buildings---two of brick and one of wood---after esteemed university figures. The larger brick edifice was named Wylie Hall, in memory of the first president, Andrew Wylie, and in honor of Professor Theophilus Wylie, who had taught for almost fifty years. The smaller brick structure was named Owen Hall, to honor three distinguished brothers, sons of Robert Owen of New Harmony, Indiana, fame, including retired professor Richard Dale Owen, who had served on the faculty since 1864.[@botm1884c] The wood frame structure, serving as the campus chapel and providing classrooms, was named after David Maxwell, the first president of the board of trustees.[@botm1885b] These honorary namings inaugurated a tradition of recognizing leaders---faculty, trustees, administrators---who had shaped the university by inscribing their names on the new campus. 

By the summer of 1888, the trustees ordered a roadway to be built connecting the eastern end of Kirkwood Avenue to Wylie Hall, "to be covered with broken stone or broken stone and gravel."[@botm1888a] Wide enough to allow two horse-drawn teams to pass, the road was near the northern edge of the Dunn's Woods plot, leaving the bulk of the property undeveloped. It also unintentionally confirmed the main entrance to the new campus at Kirkwood and Indiana Avenues.  

## Documenting the Academic Community 

In 1881, the IU trustees asked Professor Theophilus Wylie to prepare a historical catalog of the institution's history since its beginning in 1820.^[Wylie was the seventh faculty member hired and had known all but three faculty before him---Baynard Hall, John Harney, and Ebenezer Elliott---who had left before his appointment in 1837. During his forty-nine years as a professor, he taught natural science and had stints of administrative work as librarian and acting president. He was personally acquainted with every IU faculty member until at least the 1880s (he died in 1895) as well as generations of university students.] After the 1883 fire consumed the previous three decades of records, compounding the losses from an earlier fire in 1854, Wylie turned to the living members of the IU community to salvage historical information. He devised a questionnaire and embarked on extensive correspondence by postal service. Painstakingly collating and organizing reams of written responses, Wylie pressed on after his retirement in 1886. The resulting book, published in 1890, was a remarkably complete biographical compendium of names of students, faculty, presidents, and trustees, with some brief interpretive narratives interspersed. By emphasizing biography, it underlined the importance of individuals making up the academic community, forming a social institution. Wylie's book, under the descriptive title *Indiana University, Its History from 1820, When Founded, to 1890, with Biographical Sketches of Its Presidents, Professors and Graduates, and a List of Its Students from 1820 to 1887*, was long on a collective biography of the academic community and short on a descriptive history of the university. 

A decade and a half later, another contribution to IU history was published, *Indiana University, 1820--1904*, edited by history professor Samuel B. Harding. It contained a historical sketch, an analysis of curriculum development, and a bibliography of publications of faculty and alumni.[@harding1904a] For the first time, the intellectual contributions of the entire IU professorate, both past and present, were documented.  

Nearly fifty years later, a different approach was taken in the *History of Indiana University, 1902--1937*, published in 1952.^[@myers1952a. Despite its title, the book had several chapters covering the entire history from 1820 to 1937.] Retired anatomy dean Burton Myers studied IU faculty appointments from the beginning of instruction to 1937, subdividing the chronology in half: 1824 to 1885 and 1885 to 1937. The choice of the dividing line was significant: the beginning of the administration of President David Starr Jordan, who represented a break from previous clerical leadership and the promotion of a new spirit of research. Myers wrote, "In contrast with the 60 appointments to the faculty in the first sixty-one years of the life of the University, there were 897 appointments made in the fifty-two years from 1885 to 1937."[@myers1952a, p. 577.] The rise in the number of faculty appointed was a consequence of the growth of the student body over that 113-year span.^[@myers1952a. He included photographs of active faculty in 1937 who had served twenty-five years or more---fifty-two men and women in all.]

Myers's analysis was made possible by a new method of record-keeping starting circa 1935: a cumulative collection of individual faculty data collected on single sheets of paper. These biographical data sheets contained information for each faculty member, such as name, title, years of service, birth date and birthplace, educational background, previous positions, marital status, and political and religious affiliations. 

Mellie P. Cravens, wife of John Cravens, IU registrar and secretary to the board of trustees, worked in the Register of Graduates Office. In 1936, under her direction, a cumulative register of alumni between 1830 and 1935 was prepared.^[@myers1952a, pp. 479--480. Alumni records were transferred to the IU Archives in 1936. Before her marriage, Mellie had worked as a secretary for President Bryan. @myers1952a, p. 593.] Her husband, who served as President Bryan's trusted executive assistant, retired in the summer of 1936 after forty-one years of service. President Bryan, seventy-six years old, shocked the trustees by indicating in early 1937 that he wanted to retire, after thirty-five years at the helm. The trustees named Herman Wells, dean of the School of Business Administration, acting president in June 1937, giving some time to mount a proper search for a permanent replacement.^[See @capshew2012a, Chapter 5.] John Cravens died in August. Amid the flux of administrative transitions, by November the trustees authorized Wells to support the preparation of a faculty directory---a who's who of the instructional staff---for use of the board and the administration.[@botm1937a] Thus, refinements in record management techniques allowed for recent data to be integrated in cumulative reports of IU's academic community.  

## Memorializing Faculty 

Although the board of trustees had noted faculty deaths occasionally in their minutes with memorial resolutions, there was no regular policy. As the faculty grew from a small, intimate group to a larger, more heterogenous community, new president Wells suggested to the trustees that memorial resolutions be prepared for faculty upon their death. The trustees agreed with him, as noted in their 1940 minutes, but no procedure was identified to produce them.[@botm1940b] 

Wells continued to report faculty deaths at the trustees' meetings through the 1940s, but by the early 1950s, with increasing student enrollments following the war and a concomitant swelling of faculty numbers, the president instead created a necrology committee composed of seasoned faculty members. The committee was responsible for ensuring that a memorial resolution, usually written by departmental colleagues, was prepared shortly after the death of a faculty member. That was the plan, and most faculty were memorialized in this way. But a few faculty fell inadvertently through the committee's net because the faculty that had volunteered to write the resolution became too busy or forgot to complete the assignment.  

The first to chair the necrology committee was F. Lee Benns (1889--1967), a member of the history faculty since 1920. A 1937 survey indicated Benns was the most highly rated instructor among both faculty and recent honors graduates. He was "known as a very demanding teacher but one widely revered."[@madison2010a, p. 8.] When Benns retired in 1954, Dean of the Faculties Herman Briscoe wrote to John Stoner on President Wells's behalf, asking him to take on the necrologist role.[@iu_faculty_necrology] (Around this time, the role became known as the university necrologist.) Stoner (1902--1988), a member of the Department of Political Science since 1938, served as university necrologist for four years.^[Stoner retired in 1972. His colleagues [memorialized him](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/bfc/B21-1990), saying, "His career spanned the transit from the insular elitism of the pre-war school with its few thousand students to the contemporary multiversity."]  Turning to another member of the history department, in 1958 Wells recruited Associate Professor Chase Mooney (1913--1973) to serve.^[See ["MEMORIAL RESOLUTION ON THE DEATH OF CHASE C. MOONEY"](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/bfc/B22-1974).]  

Records documenting the history of the necrology committee in the 1960s are lacking, but archival sources note that history professor Oscar Winther (1903--1970) chaired the committee starting in 1964^[See ["MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR OSCAR OSBURN WINTHER"](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/bfc/B22-1971)] and that folklorist John Ashton (1900--1971), former dean of the graduate school, directed the committee's work until 1970.^[[Ashton's faculty memorial resolution](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/bfc/B35-1972) did not mention this role.] From 1970 to 1973, history professor Donald Carmony (1910--2005), editor of the *Indiana Magazine of History*, chaired the committee. 

In 1973, President Ryan appointed chemistry professor Harry Day (1906--2007) to the position of university necrologist. Day, a member of the team that created the first fluoridated toothpaste in the 1950s, had been at the university since 1940 and served various administrative roles, including chemistry chair and associate dean for research and advanced studies. Aided by his longtime secretary, Elizabeth Greene (1921--2011), he conducted all aspects of his career with effectiveness and dispatch. Although he retired in 1976, at seventy years of age, Day continued as necrologist for sixteen years, until 1989. By the time he reached eighty, Day appended an appeal to be relieved of his duties to his annual necrology report.  

Historical research occupied the energies of both Day and Greene into the 1990s. Day embarked on a history of chemical instruction at IU, dating back to 1837, when Theophilus Wylie was hired as a faculty member in the natural sciences.^[Wylie was a cousin of Andrew Wylie, the first president, who died in 1851.] Not only was chemistry a venerable subject of teaching, but the department had also grown to be the largest among the science departments at IU. In the course of his research, Day discovered the existence of Wylie's extensive personal diaries in the university archives. The diaries gave details about Wylie's activities during the greater part of the nineteenth century, including his family life and university events, often with an indication of his personal reactions. Greene laboriously transcribed the faded handwriting into typescript. Archivist Dolores Lahrman (1920--1997) and her staff assisted in translating the frequent Greek, Latin, and French phrases that Wylie used to express his meaning. 

The transcription of the diaries was completed in 1987, with Greene providing a preface and Day supplying an introduction. Wylie's diaries became an invaluable source for both Bloomington and IU history of the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Later, staff at the IU Archives discovered some missing diaries, and Greene dutifully transcribed those too, completing the work in 1992.^[See [archival description of Theophilus Wylie's diaries](https://archives.iu.edu/catalog/InU-Ar-VAA1230).] The same year, Day published his historical chronicle, entitled *The Development of Chemistry at Indiana University, 1829--1991*.[@day1992a] Nearly seven hundred pages, it was a meticulous compendium of names, dates, and facts about every aspect of teaching and research in the discipline as it was practiced at the university. 

In 1989, Day's importuning about a replacement yielded fruit, as President Tom Ehrlich appointed English professor Donald Gray (b. 1927) as university necrologist. Gray, a specialist in Victorian literature, joined the English faculty in 1956. He was a superb teacher, supervising dozens of Ph.D. dissertation students, and a noted editor, publishing the Norton *Pride and Prejudice* and *Alice in Wonderland* as well as serving as editor of the academic journals *College English* and *Victorian Studies*. He also edited and contributed to *The Department of English at Indiana University Bloomington, 1868--1970*, published in 1973, following the observance of the IU sesquicentennial in 1970.[@gray1973a] 

Gray had witnessed the university's growth and diversification for a third of a century upon his appointment and had extensive contacts in the faculty and administration. The new job meant increased exchanges with every school on the Bloomington campus plus coordinating information from other campuses from around the state. Gray was quietly effective, working with faculty colleagues as they crafted memorial sketches of their late peers, often supplying insights to their personalities and their impact on university life. 

Once written, faculty memorial resolutions were read aloud at meetings of the Bloomington Faculty Council (BFC), co-chaired by the BFC president and the campus's presiding officer, first the Bloomington chancellor and more recently the Bloomington provost. In 2010, education professor Robert Arnove questioned "the process by which memorial resolutions are prepared and brought before this body" because "a number of colleagues have passed away in 2008 and 2009 and I haven't seen anything for them." Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs Thomas Gieryn explained:

>We've worked very, very hard---"we" being Don Gray, the campus necrologist and emeriti faculty members and I---have worked hard contacting deans and chairs of all the departments to provide memorial resolutions. We beg them, we give them models, we tell them it's not that onerous. It gets difficult sometimes and I noticed certainly as you did that sometimes it takes a great deal of time to find the right person to write the resolution. We encourage all colleagues who know of someone who has died who has not had a memorial resolution read to bring that to the attention of their chair so that we can reach that closure.[@bfcm2010a] 

To be sure, a few deceased faculty members escaped the necrologist's net, but this unique historical record grew year upon year, providing informed summations of faculty careers and a symbolic closure to university service. 

Professor Gray soldiered on as university necrologist for decade after decade, cajoling faculty writers and editing their prose, on every campus of the university. Over time, however, as campus autonomy grew in Indianapolis and in the regionals and administrative personnel changed, the other campuses stopped sending information about faculty deaths. By the time she left office in 2011, Provost Karen Hanson suggested Gray's title be changed to IUB necrologist. In 2017, after twenty-eight years, he penned a short memo, "The IU Necrologist: Duties and Procedures," based on his experience, and submitted a request to the university administration to be relieved of this duty.[@gray2017a]

Gray got his wish the following year. He was now ninety years old and in his sixty-second year of service at Indiana University. In February 2018, Provost Lauren Robel presented a verbal encomium at a regular meeting of the BFC, right after the customary reading of the latest faculty memorial resolution. She prefaced her remarks with a verse of Victorian poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson, from his famous poem, *In Memoriam A.H.H.*:

> I sing to him that rests below,  
> And, since the grasses round me wave,  
> I take the grasses of the grave,  
> And make them pipes whereon to blow.  

She began her tribute to Gray by noting, "We start every meeting of the Bloomington Faculty Council with our memorial resolutions. And it is extraordinarily fitting that we do so. The resolutions are human and charming and grounding and give us a sense of our history and our colleagues, and the vast range of the interest represented on this campus." She continued by introducing Gray and commending his work as the university necrologist. 

Robel remarked that Gray was a leading scholar of Victorian literature, thus her choice of Tennyson's elegy, musing that his scholarship might have motivated his nearly thirty years of service as necrologist, "or perhaps it was simply his love for Indiana University and his understanding of the importance of this role." Regardless, "Don has done incredibly important work" for his university colleagues, for the campus, and for the family and friends of departed faculty members.[@iubfc2018a] 

Gray turned his files on university necrology over to the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs during the 2017--18 academic year. Indermohan Virk, a staff member responsible for the Patten Foundation lecture series, added the role of campus necrologist to her portfolio. In her duties, she works with the leadership of BFC and colleagues of deceased faculty to craft an appropriate memorial resolution, which is read into the record during regular council meetings. 

## The Bicentennial Era 

Amid his long service as necrologist, Gray embarked on a collateral project to collect video interviews of emeriti professors. Begun in 2005, it was a way to collect stories of faculty experiences from retired academics. Similar in concept to the oral history center, initiated in 1970 as part of the university's sesquicentennial commemoration, it gathered personal narratives of faculty careers. In 2008, it was folded into the Bicentennial Oral History Project to capture alumni recollections in advance of the 2020 institutional anniversary. Teachers and students contributed vital data to this ongoing effort. Gray expressed the rationale of the emeriti project: "What we were trying to get, I think, is a picture of what a faculty member did, how it changed and how the students changed."^[["Brownlee preserves stories of emeriti faculty"](https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/news-events/news/item.html?n=brownlee-preserves-stories-of-emeriti-faculty)] By 2017, Gray had conducted 150 interviews and bequeathed the project to two other emeriti professors, Bonnie Brownlee and Bruce Jaffee, both younger.^[See also [*Indiana University Bicentennial Final Report*](https://web.archive.org/web/20230413202919/https://200.iu.edu/doc/IU-bicentennial-final.pdf) (Bloomington: Indiana University, 2020), 30--31.] 

The Office of the Bicentennial was created in 2016 to plan, coordinate, and implement a wide array of public events to shed light on the history of Indiana University, culminating in the institution's 200th anniversary on January 20, 2020.^[A good overview is provided in the *Indiana University Bicentennial Final Report*.] Special attention was paid to documenting the history of students, faculty, administrators, and alumni. Staff at the Office of the Registrar helped with statistical analyses of the historical demography of the student body, providing estimates of the total number of individuals taking at least one course since the beginning of instruction in 1825 (nearly 2,000,000) and the count of graduates (approaching 1,000,000). A website featuring biographical profiles of the first 200 graduates was produced, and then coverage was extended to all degree recipients.^[[The Degree Compendium](https://allgrads.indiana.edu/) and [The First 200](https://first200.iu.edu/)] In a similar fashion, the faculty records group within the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs provided data on the number and characteristics of instructional staff since classes began in 1825. Because of historical changes in the definition of faculty as well as incomplete records, they could only give a ballpark estimate, which was near 50,000. In contrast, because of the smaller numbers of trustees and officers, the administration has proven easier to document its historical demography. The Office of the Bicentennial chose to continue a long-running series of volumes of biographical sketches that stretched back to Theophilus Wylie's 1890 IU history. The result was *Trustees and Officers of Indiana University, Volume III: 1982--2018*, with a team of five editors and numerous contributors. The historical total of trustees and officers was about 650 individuals.^[@buckley2019a. The first historical list is found in @wylie1890a; earlier volumes were @myers1951a and @roehr1983a.] 

As a human institution, it remains important to document the members of the academic community and their activities. The first history of Indiana University, published in 1890, was a successful attempt to reconstruct the names and careers of individual members of the bodies of students, faculty, and administrators of the institution's first seven decades in the face of incomplete historical data. By 1900, the office of the registrar was established and had devised a system to track each student who matriculated and those who graduated. As enrollments grew, the number of graduates increased, and the alumni association established a collateral tracking system as it underwent professionalization in the first quarter of the twentieth century.^[See @shirley2004a] By 1935, administrators had rationalized faculty recordkeeping, facilitating administrative reporting and historical documentation. Although the media and techniques of recordkeeping have changed over time, maintaining accurate and complete records of each member of the academic community continues to be a core aspect of IU's identity and makes possible historical analysis, reflection, and celebration.
