#| fig-cap: IU campus footprint over time (1885–2020), according to official campus maps, from twenty acres at the beginning to nearly 2,000 acres at present.<br><br>This interactive map illustrates the expansion of Indiana University Bloomington’s campus by overlaying its boundaries from the official campus maps of 1885, 1915, 1940, 1960, 1980, and 2020 onto a contemporary street map of Bloomington.<br><br>Sighted users can explore the map by toggling year layers to compare how the campus's shape and extent have changed. Screen reader users should refer to the static version (@fig-map), as interactive maps do not support alt text.
